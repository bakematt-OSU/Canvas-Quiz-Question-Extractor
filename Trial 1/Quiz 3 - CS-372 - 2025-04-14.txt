----------------------------------------
Question 1:
A client in a network with a proxy server requests a 5 MiB file from an internet server, fakeservername.com. The network’s proxy server has a 1.2 Mbps connection to fakeservername.com. The average response time between the network’s proxy server and the internet origin server (including RTT) is 2.1 seconds for a small “header-only” HTTP request/response. The file requested by the client is currently in the proxy server cache, but the proxy server relays the client’s request to the internet server with “if-modified since”.Assume that transmissions between the proxy and the origin servers are stream (not packets) at full bandwidth, with negligible propagation delay.How much time is saved if the file has not been modified? (Give answer in seconds, without units, rounded to two decimal places, so for an answer of 1.4233 seconds you would enter "1.42" without the quotes.)

  ❌ Option 1: HTTP/2 has many new HTTP methods and status codes. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 4: HTTP/2 provides enhanced security by using transport layer security (TLS). - Incorrect
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Question 26:
We learned that in HTTP web browser caching, HTTP local web server caching, and in local DNS caching, that a user benefits (e.g., shorter delays over the case of no caching) from finding a local/nearby copy of a requested item. In which of the following forms of caching does a user benefit from its not only from its own recent requests (and cached replies)but also from recent requests made from other users?

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Question 28:
What is the purpose of a cookie value in the HTTP GET request?
  ✔ Option 4: The cookie value itself doesn't mean anything. It is just a value that was returned by a web server to this client during an earlier interaction. - Correct
  ❌ Option 1: The cookie value encodes the format of the reply preferred by the client in the response to this GET request. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 2: The cookie value indicates whether the user wants to use HTTP/1, HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/2 for this GET request. - Incorrect

  ✔ Option 2: DNS caching results in less load elsewhere in DNS, when the reply to a query is found in the local cache. - Correct
  ❌ Option 3: DNS caching provides prioritized access to the root servers, since the DNS request is from a local DNS cache. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 4: DNS caching provides the ability to serve as authoritative name server for multiple organizations. - Incorrect
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Question 30:
What is the purpose of the conditional HTTP GET request message?

  ❌ Option 2: To allow a server to only send the requested object to the client if the client is authorized to receive that object. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 3: To allow a server to only send the requested object to the client if the server is not overloaded. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 4: To allow a server to only send the requested object to the client if the client has never requested that object before. - Incorrect
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
Question 31:
Consider the following scenario, in which a Web browser (lower) connects to a web server (above).  There is no web cache in this question (so make sure you understand the difference between a browser cache and a web cache).  Assume that the total Round Trip Time (RTT) propagation and queueing delay between the browser and web server is 200 msec.Suppose that whenever the browser makes an HTTP request to the server for any HTTP object on that site, that the browser has a copy of that object in its cache (the user loves to get content  from that site!), but that copy may or may not be up-to-date in its cache (and so the browser requests the object using the HTTPIf-Modified-Sinceheader field).  Assume that the time taken to transmit any HTTP reply (by the sender into the TCP connection) that contains a requested object in the body of an HTTP reply is 50 msec (again, for all objects), but that the time taken to transmit a HTTP reply with a “304 Not Modified” reply code without an included object is negligible (e.g., zero). You can assume that a TCP connection has always been set up, so do not include that delay in your answer below.Suppose that 90% of the HTTP requests are for objects that are up-to-date in the browser's cache, and so 10% are cache "misses" and will require the up-to-date object to be downloaded, and browser-cached. What is the average time (over all requests that the browser makes to this site) from when the browser issues the initial HTTP GET request until it is able to display the requested object?
  ✔ Option 5: 400 msec - Correct
  ❌ Option 1: 205 msec - Incorrect

Question 32:
Consider the following scenario, in which a Web browser (lower) connects to a web server (above).  There is also a local web cache in the bowser’s access network.  In this question, we will ignore browser caching (so make sure you understand the difference between a browser cache and a web cache). In this question, we want to focus on the utilization of the 100 Mbps access link between the two networks.Suppose that each requested object is 10 Mbits, and that 9 HTTP requests per second are being made to origin servers from the clients in the access network.  Suppose that 80% of the requested objects by the client are found in the local web cache. What is theutilizationof the access link?

Question 33:
Consider the following scenario, in which a Web browser (lower) connects to a web server (above).  There is no web cache in this question (so make sure you understand the difference between a browser cache and a web cache).  Assume that the total Round Trip Time (RTT) propagation and queueing delay between the browser and web server is 200 msec.Suppose that the browser makes an HTTP request to the server for an HTTP object, that the browser has a copy of that object in its cache, but that copy may or may not be up-to-date in its cache (and so the browser requests the object using the HTTPIf-Modified-Sinceheader field).  Assume that the time taken to transmit an HTTP reply (by the sender into the TCP connection) that contains a requested object in the body of an HTTP reply is 50 msec, but that the time taken to transmit a HTTP reply with a “304 Not Modified” reply code without an included object is negligible (e.g., zero). You can assume that a TCP connection has already been set up, so do not include that delay in your answer below.What is the time from when the browser issues the initial HTTP GET request until it is able to display the requested object in the case that the browserdoeshave the requested object in its browser cache?
  ✔ Option 3: 200 msec - Correct
  ❌ Option 1: 250 msec - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 2: 100 msec - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 4: 500 msec - Incorrect

Question 34:
Consider again the scenario shown in the figure below,Assume that the client and server have not communicated before, that the client knows the server's IP address, and that HTTP 1.1 is being used. Now assume that the client has a browser cache (but no web cache). The browser cache is initially empty, and all GET request messages have anIf-Modified-Sincefield.The HTTP client:again makes a first GET request to the leftmost server for a base page that it has never before requested; the base page contains a reference to an embedded jpeg object.makes a second GET request for that embedded object.then makes a third GET request (a very short time later) for thesameembedded jpeg object (with that third GET request having an  If-Modified-Since field).Let's focus onjust this thirdHTTP GET request.How many round trip times (RTTs) are needed from when the browser issues thethirdHTTP GET request, until the reply for that third GET request is received?You should take into account any TCP setup time (if any) required before an HTTP GET is  sent by the client, the time needed for the server to transmit a requested object (if any), and any propagation delays (if any)not accounted for in these other amounts of time.
  ✔ Option 4: 2 RTT - Correct
  ❌ Option 1: 0 RTT - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 2: 1.0 RTT - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 3: 1.25 RTT - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 5: 2.25 RTT - Incorrect

Question 35:
Suppose that the local DNS server caches all information coming in from all root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers for 20 time units. (Thus, for example, when a root server returns the name and address of a TLD server for .com, the cache remembers that this is the TLD server to use to resolve a .com name).  Assume also that the local cache is initially empty, that iterative DNS queries are always used, that DNS requests are just for name-to-IP-address translation, that 1 time unit is needed for each server-to-server or host-to-server (one way) request or response, and that there is only one authoritative name server (each) for any .edu or .com domain.Consider the following DNS requests, made by the local host at the given times:t=0,the local host requests that the name gaia.cs.umass.edu be resolved to an IP address.t=1,the local host requests that the name icann.org be resolved to an IP address.t=5,the local host requests that the name cs.umd.edu be resolved to an IP address. (Hint: be careful!)t=10,the local hostagainrequests that the name gaia.cs.umass.edu be resolved to an IP address.t=12, the local host requests that the name cs.mit.edu be resolved to an IP address.t=30,the local hostagainrequests that the name gaia.cs.umass.edu be resolved to an IP address. (Hint: be careful!)Which of the requests require 8 time units to be resolved?
  ✔ Option 1: The request at t=0. - Correct
  ❌ Option 2: The request at t=1. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 3: The request at t=5. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 4: The request at t=10. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 5: The request at t=12. - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 6: The request at t=30. - Incorrect

Question 36:
Consider an HTTP 1.0 client and server. The RTT delay between the client and server is 2 seconds.  Suppose the time a server needs to transmit an object into its outgoing link is 3 seconds, as shown below for the first of these 100 requests.You can assume that any other HTTP message not containing an object sent by the client and server has a negligible (zero) transmission time. Suppose the client makes 100 requests, one after the other, waiting for a reply to a request before sending the next request.Using HTTP 1.0, how much time elapses between the client transmitting the first request, and the receipt of the last requested object?
  ✔ Option 1: 700 secs - Correct
  ❌ Option 2: 502 secs - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 3: 500 secs - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 4: 300 secs - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 5: 203 secs - Incorrect

----------------------------------------
Question 37:
Suppose an HTTP client makes a request to the gaia.cs.umass.edu web server.  The client has never before requested a given base object, nor has it communicated recently with the gaia.cs.umass.edu server. You can assume, however, that the client host knows the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu.Suppose also that after downloading the base file, the browser encounters a jpeg object in the base html file that is stored on gaia.cs.umass.edu, and therefore makes another GET request to gaia.cs.umass.edu for that referenced jpeg object.How many round trip times (RTTs) are needed from when the client first makes the request to when the base page and the jpeg file are completely downloaded, assuming the time needed by the server to transmit the base file, or the jpeg file into the server's link is (each) equal to 1/2 RTT and that the time needed to transmit the HTTP GET into the client's link is zero.You should assume that HTTP 1.0 is being used.(You should take into account any TCP setup time required before an HTTP GET is actually sent by the client,  the time needed for the server to transmit the requested object, and any propagation delays not accounted for in these amounts of time.)
  ✔ Option 4: 2 RTT - Correct
  ❌ Option 1: 2.5 RTT - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 2: 5 RTT - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 3: 1 RTT - Incorrect
  ❌ Option 5: 4 RTT - Incorrect
